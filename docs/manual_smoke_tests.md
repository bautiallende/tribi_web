## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Unable to load countries"

**Solution:**

- Check backend is running on port 8000
- Check CORS is enabled in backend
- Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE` is NOT set to wrong value (should be empty or `http://localhost:8000`)

### Issue: "Unexpected token '<'" JSON error

**Solution:**

- This means the web app is hitting the Next.js server instead of the backend
- Verify `apiUrl()` is being used from `@/lib/apiConfig`
- Check that API_BASE defaults to `http://localhost:8000` when env var is not set

### Issue: Mobile "expo-updates" plugin error

**Solution:**

- Verify `plugins` array is removed from `app.config.js`
- Only keep the `updates` object with `enabled: false`

### Issue: Admin access denied

**Solution:**

- Add user email to `ADMIN_EMAILS` in `apps/backend/.env`
- Restart backend
- Check console logs for the exact reason access was denied

### Issue: Orders don't show in account

**Solution:**

- Check auth token is present in localStorage (web) or SecureStore (mobile)
- Verify `/api/orders/mine` endpoint returns data in backend console
- Check network tab for 401/403 errors

## Expected Console Log Patterns

### Good Web Auth Flow:

```
🔑 Requesting OTP for: test@example.com
🔗 Endpoint: http://localhost:8000/api/auth/request-code
🌐 API Request: POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/request-code
📥 API Response: 200 OK
✅ API Success: {message: "OTP sent"}
✅ OTP sent successfully
```

### Good Mobile Startup:

```
🚫 OTA update error ignored in dev build: [optional error message]
📡 API Request: GET /api/countries
✅ API Success: [...150 countries...]
```

### Good Account Load:

```
👤 Fetching user profile...
📦 Fetching orders...
📶 Fetching eSIMs...
✅ User profile loaded: {email: "test@example.com"}
✅ Orders loaded: 3 orders
✅ eSIMs loaded: 2 eSIMs
```
